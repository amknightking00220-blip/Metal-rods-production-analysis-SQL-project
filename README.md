# Metal-rods-production-analysis-SQL-project
This project demonstrates the application of Statistical Process Control (SPC) techniques on a manufacturing process producing metal rods.
The goal is to monitor process stability, variation, and defect behavior using industry-standard control charts and present insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.
The project simulates a real-world quality control scenario commonly used in manufacturing industries.

Objectives :

Analyze process stability over time

Identify special causes of variation

Monitor defect rate and defect counts

Translate statistical results into business-friendly insights

Build a human-readable quality dashboard

Tools & Technologies :

Power BI – Dashboard creation & DAX calculations

SQL Server (SSMS) – Data storage & querying

CSV Dataset – Simulated manufacturing inspection data

SPC Methodology – X̄, R, P, and NP control charts

Control Charts Used & Interpretation :
 X̄ (X-Bar) Chart – Average Diameter Control
Purpose:
Monitors whether the average rod diameter remains stable across batches.

R Chart – Within-Batch Variation
Purpose:
Tracks variation within each batch to ensure consistency.

P Chart – Defect Proportion
Purpose:
Monitors the percentage of defective rods per batch.

NP Chart – Number of Defectives
Purpose:
Tracks the count of defective rods per batch.

Insights:
Some batches produce unusually high numbers of defective rods, suggesting intermittent problems in the manufacturing process
